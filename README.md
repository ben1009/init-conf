## provide the basic setup for rust project

- github actions
  - checks (fmt, clippy, test, coverage, typos with nightly and beta versions, mutil-os)
  - coverage (codecov)
- rustfmt config
- toolchain
- cargo makefile with dev as entrypoint

- `main.rs` is just for test all the workflows, could be removed when import to the other project
- When init a new project:

  ```shell
  git remote add conf https://github.com/ben1009/init-conf.git
  git fetch conf
  git merge --allow-unrelated-histories conf/master
  ```

  By using this strategy the history of the repo is included in the new repo, and future updates can be merged later.
